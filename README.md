# boaconnector_android
Android library to enable connecting SqlBoa to a live sqlite database


Most sqlite editors edit local database files.  SQLBoa has the ability to communicate with live databases on an android device or emulator.  This library is the android app side of the equation.

Integration is very easy, see the package com.sqlboaconnector.sample for an example
